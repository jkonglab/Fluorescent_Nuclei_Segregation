# Clumped Nuclei Segmentation

This is an implementation of nuclei segmentation method for segregating clumped nuclei in DAPI in Fluorescence images.

## Dataset

Image patches are used for analysis.

	* (Image patches: 20, random size, 1024*1376 pixels)

## Code Excecution

Clone the repository and execute `Nuclei_Seg.m` that reads an image and some predefined parameters to segment clumped  nuclei and plots the connecting lines on the original images.
